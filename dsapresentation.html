 # Stigma & Health Information Seeking Behaviors of LGBTQ+ Individuals with Substance Use Concerns
 
 DSA Research Activity Lightning Round
 Simmons University
 November 13, 2020
 
 <!-- Slide number: 2 -->
 # Who am I?
 2017 cohort
 Background as a science librarian
 Non-binary bisexual (pronouns they/them)
 Personal experience with mental health issues
 Affiliated with “rainbow recovery” groups and populations
 
 “[…] research has shown contact to yield the best changes in stereotypes, prejudice, and discrimination”
 (Corrigan & Matthews, 2003, 236)
 
 <!-- Slide number: 3 -->
 # Terminology
 LGBTQ+ / SGM / queer
 LGBTQ+: Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Queer/Questioning, other identities
 Better stated as SGM: Sexual and Gender Minority/ies
 Queer: Term used to describe a variety of SGM. Not always welcome by all. Used by me to describe myself.
 
 Allow people to identify themselves and utilize their terminology when discussing the individual. Many identities intersect. Sexuality, sexual/romantic, and gender are not determinants of each other, and are fluid.
 
 <!-- Slide number: 4 -->
 # Terminology
 Shame
 Scheer et al. (2019) defines shame as “an affective and cognitive state marked by negative self-judgment stemming from an actual or perceived transgression of social norms […] a psychological state involving global negative evaluation of the self in which the individual feels inferior, helpless, vulnerable, and desires to hide […] marked by feelings of inferiority and powerlessness that are directly tied to social ostracism and trauma” (pp. 1-2).
 Minority stress theory
 SGM experience social stressors due to stigmatize identities
 
 <!-- Slide number: 5 -->
 # Terminology
 Stigma
 Public stigma: what a public does to a group if prejudice is endorsed
 Self-stigma: internalization of public stigma
 Public and self-stigma reinforce each other
 Stigmatizing response
 Labeling, by others or by association
 Stereotypes (violence, incompetence, blame for illness)
 Prejudice: endorsement of negative stereotypes
 Discriminatory behavior (in group v. out group)
 Stigma and discrimination (SAD)
 Negligence/violence
 Breaches of confidentiality & gossip
 Poor support
 Delay or denial of treatment, differential treatment, unnecessary referrals
 
 If someone accepts public stigma, then they’re less likely to pursue treatment for themself.
 This includes health information seeking.
 
 <!-- Slide number: 6 -->
 # Hypothesis
 When people internalize stigma and discrimination, this causes them to feel shame, which impacts a propensity toward substance use, abuse, and addiction.
 Stigma related to SGM identities, coupled with that about mental health—and substance issues in particular—impacts health information seeking behaviors.
 
 “Stigma can shape stigmatized individuals’ cognitive, affective, and behavioral processes”
 (Lin et al., 2019, 286)
 
 <!-- Slide number: 7 -->
 # Terminology
 Substance use/abuse/addition
 Different levels and chemicals
 Debatable about what counts as a “drug”: most of my work is with people who are members of Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) and Narcotics Anonymous (NA), but there is a variety of recovery groups for all manner of addictions.
 Addiction is tricky to define. Use Substance Use Disorder (SUD).
 SUD criteria include cravings, inability to stop using despite desire, taking in larger amounts or for longer periods, neglecting other life activities, relationship issues as a result of use, use despite danger
 DSMV-5 Use Disorders codes: Alcohol; Phencyclidine; Inhalant; Stimulant; Cannabis; Other Hallucinogen; Opioid; Tobacco; Sedative, Hypnotic, or Anxiolytic
 
 <!-- Slide number: 8 -->
 # Background
 SGM disproportionately face exposure to traumatic events, especially if they have other stigmatized identities (e.g., race).
 Due in part to SAD and related trauma, SGM individuals are more likely to experience mental health disorders.
 Exposure to such events can also spark what may have remained latent disorders like bipolar or borderline.
 Stigma impacts drug use: people turn to drugs--including alcohol--in an effort to combat issues that arise when one is shamed/stigmatized/abused/traumatized, etc.: anxiety, depression, PTSD, etc.
 
 <!-- Slide number: 9 -->
 # Background
 As people physically/psychologically use substances to cope (self-medicate) for mental health issues, their chances of developing Substance Use Disorder increase.
 Addiction is complex: physical as well as spiritual, emotional as well as mental.
 Cessation is not a cure: for example, protracted withdrawal symptoms from alcohol include increased anxiety and depression, which if you keep quitting restarting quitting again can cause "kindling,” a reoccurrence of issues.
 
 <!-- Slide number: 10 -->
 # Background
 This can last for a while after cessation of alcohol use: some studies say a year.
 Some people in sobriety say this narrative is false and that alcoholism and other addictions are moral failures. This places additional shame/stigma on addicts.
 Increased shame/stigma results in lower rates of health information seeking.
 
 <!-- Slide number: 11 -->
 # Health information seeking behavior
 HISB is “an agglomeration of information and method behaviors” (Lambert & Loiselle, 2007, 1015).
 Generally considered to be an active rather than a passive process, conducted in a dynamic, fluid, and non-linear manner.
 Typically studied within three contexts:
 Coping with threats to health
 Involvement with medical decision making
 Changing behavior to prevent illness
 Lack of research into the role basic psychological mechanisms play in motivations for engaging in ISB (Dubnjakovic, 2017);
 A person’s need for information will not necessarily lead to their seeking information.
 
 <!-- Slide number: 12 -->
 # Health information seeking
 When queer people then go to search for info about dealing with addiction, they encounter stigma/shame again about addictions as well as SGM identity/ies.
 The medical establishment has stigmatized and disserved SGM and SUD (not to mention people who are both) and this leads to further fear when seeking help for substance abuse.
 
 <!-- Slide number: 13 -->
 # Health information seeking
 Most individuals utilize multiple channels and sources for health information, which are selected based on personal and situational factors.
 Most people prefer interpersonal and Internet information sources.
 While interpersonal sources, particularly people who have experienced similar health and social concerns, can be beneficial and a way of developing relationships, “not all questions can be answered out of the conversation within the […] community” (Schaller, 2011, p. 105).
 Internet sources can also create an impediment to gathering accurate health messages, as not all information on the Internet is accurate and many people, including clinicians, lack necessary health literacy to determine which messages are factual.
 
 <!-- Slide number: 14 -->
 # Health information seeking
 Younger people more likely to seek treatment than older; whites more likely to seek treatment than minorities.
 Situations of information poverty increase dependence on and trust of word-of-mouth information seeking.
 Negative experience of one person can impact many others.
 Word of mouth extends to Internet information seeking.
 Vulnerability of stigmatized individuals
 SUD vulnerability during recovery
 SGM isolation, loneliness, ostracization
 
 <!-- Slide number: 15 -->
 # Health information seeking
 Society and culture are shaped by technology.
 Since information is deeply connected with technology and culture, “[o]ne way for information studies to better serve the constituents of feminism, critical race theory, post-colonialism, and queer theory is to engage with cultural inquiry and humanistic methods.” (Kielty, 2013, 5).
 
 <!-- Slide number: 16 -->
 # Health information seeking
 Internet is “a virtual lifeline” for SGM individuals: place to explore identity and connect with others rather than living in isolation (Greenblatt, 2011, 1).
 The “digital closet” is “systematic viewpoint discrimination against LGBTQ sites and information perpetrated by a number of commercial filters. […] invisibility has been the great enemy of truth about minority sexual orientation” (Schrader, 2013, 88).
 Tumblr closing of material deemed sexually explicit was discriminatory and created a potentially deadly lack of information, especially for young people.
 
 "There is such an uneven way in which information moves through the internet […] Those who have the most money and the most technical skill are able to control different kinds of narratives” (Noble, 2020).
 
 <!-- Slide number: 17 -->
 # Health information seeking
 Organizational patterns in classification and research are not made objectively and do not operate free of bias.
 Classification reaches beyond the catalog
 Gender classification in record-keeping has disastrous effects for SGM individuals, especially vulnerable populations.
 Create non-normative categories
 Critical cataloging: questioning biases in classification
 Placement tells an ideological story
 Start this interrogation through user experience, self-definition
 Engaging users in questioning the catalog: dialog rather than compliance
 
 “[…] catalogs reflect a particular point of view rather than an objective truth […]”
 (Drabinski, 2013, 105).
 
 <!-- Slide number: 18 -->
 # Queer theory
 Queering: denaturalizing essentialist categories
 Constructionist: sexuality and gender are defined by culture and history
 Poststructuralist: no objective or universal sexuality or gender truths
 Identity and categories as fluid
 Culturally dependent
 Constantly shifting
 Gender, sex, and attraction are not determinant of each other.
 Binaries as harmful
 For gender/sexuality as well as mental health
 “The gendering process frequently involves creating hierarchies between the divisions it enacts. One or more categories or sexed identity are privileged or devalued" (Beasley, 2005, 11).
 
 Application of queer theory to LIS, particularly HISB, can improve the information environment for SGM and other populations.
 
 <!-- Slide number: 19 -->
 # Populations
 SGM special interest recovery groups
 Alcoholics Anonymous
 Narcotics Anonymous
 SGM focused mental healthcare facilities
 Fenway Health
 Triangle Program (HRI Hospital)
 Online communities
 Discord
 Reddit
 
 <!-- Slide number: 20 -->
 # Importance
 Stigma is a social injustice, important because it creates a “major barrier” to treatment seeking and adherence as well as the ability for a person to achieve quality of life and meet life goals (Corrigan, 2004, 619).
 Of the five categories of SAD reduction, at least two can be assisted in library spaces: information-based and skills building; contact-based is also a possibility.
 
 “Information behavior research could benefit from critical perspectives on knowledge and knowers, particularly on what it means to share information and what it means to be silenced, and on how knowledge is experienced differently by different groups of people” (Williams, 2013, 425).
